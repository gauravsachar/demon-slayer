      <div  className='textanalysis'>NEZUKO- Tanjiro's younger sister, who has been turned into a demon.
Though a demon, she never attacks humans, thanks to both Urokodaki's hypnotic suggestion and the strength of her own will. She joins Tanjiro in his fight against the demons using her own demonic powers.</div>

      <div  className='textanalysis'>He joins the Demon Slayer Corps at the same time as Tanjiro and Inosuke.
He has an acute sense of hearing and can identify the sounds made by other people or demons.
In battle, when he is scared to death, he falls asleep and his personality changes to the swordsman that can unleash Thunder Breathing.</div>

      Hashibira Inosuke is another character to look forward to. He’s quite annoying like Zenitsu, too. He’s annoyingly loud. All he knows is fight and having a fight. I thought he’s one of the antagonist when they met him but I guess they need a weird teammate as well. Although his body is so manly, he has a very cute face. Almost too girly.
